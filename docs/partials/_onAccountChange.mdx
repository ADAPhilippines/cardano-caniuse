## `api.onAccountChange`

Errors: `Unknown`

Emitted when the user changes accounts (i.e. different root key pair and/or network id). The same `api` object will continue to work but will now return results based on the new account. After this event is received dApps should check `api.getNetworkId()` as changing accounts can also change the network.
