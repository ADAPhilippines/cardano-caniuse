## `api.signTx(tx: cbor<transaction>, partialSign: bool = false): Promise<cbor<transaction_witness_set>>`

Errors: `APIError`, `TxSignError`

Requests that a user sign the unsigned portions of the supplied transaction. The wallet should ask the user for permission, and if given, try to sign the supplied body and return a signed transaction. If `partialSign` is true, the wallet only tries to sign what it can. If `partialSign` is false and the wallet could not sign the entire transaction, `TxSignError` shall be returned with the `ProofGeneration` code. Likewise if the user declined in either case it shall return the `UserDeclined` code. Only the portions of the witness set that were signed as a result of this call are returned to encourage dApps to verify the contents returned by this endpoint while building the final transaction.
