## `api.getBalance(): Promise<cbor<value>>`

Errors: `APIError`

Returns the total balance available of the wallet. This is the same as summing the results of `api.getUtxos()`, but it is both useful to dApps and likely already maintained by the implementing wallet in a more efficient manner so it has been included in the API as well.
